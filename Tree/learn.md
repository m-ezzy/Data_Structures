# Traversal
Traversal refers to visiting every node in a tree, exactly once. In other words, it's a way of iterating over a tree data structure. The order in which the nodes are visited is called a traversal order. Some common traversal orders include preorder, inorder, and postorder.

# Searching
Searching refers to visiting nodes in a tree in a systematic manner to find a specific node or value. In other words, it's a way of looking up information in a tree data structure. The search algorithm can be either recursive or iterative.
